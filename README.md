## 📊 Data Model

The system architecture is built around three core entities:

- **User**
  - Secure profile data
  - Authentication credentials
  - Ownership of interview sessions

- **Interview Session**
  - Role and experience level
  - Session metadata and timestamps
  - Collection of generated questions

- **Interview Question**
  - AI-generated question
  - AI-generated answer
  - Detailed AI explanation
  - User-written notes
  - Pinned status for revision

## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

The application uses **Centralized Prompt Management** to ensure consistent, high-quality AI output and long-term maintainability.

- **Generation Prompt**
  - Adapts question complexity based on role and seniority

- **Answer Prompt**
  - Produces industry-aligned, technically accurate answers

- **Explanation Prompt**
  - Breaks concepts down into *how* and *why*
  - Designed for first-principles understanding

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Our design choices are guided by the goal of transforming passive browsing into active learning.

* **Interview-First Thinking:** Every feature mirrors the flow and technical pressure of a real-world interview, ensuring users are mentally prepared for the actual event.
* **Minimal UI Noise:** We use a clean, distraction-free interface to reduce cognitive load, allowing users to focus entirely on the technical content.
* **Revision Efficiency:** Features like "Pinning" and "Structured Notes" are specifically optimized for fast recall during last-minute preparation and long-term retention.
* **AI as an Assistant:** The AI is designed to guide, explain, and probe—it serves as a mentor that encourages deep understanding rather than a tool for copy-pasting answers.
